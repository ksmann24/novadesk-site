<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 09/22/25 </p>
<p>NovaDesk (“we”, “us”) provides lead capture and booking services. This policy explains what we collect and how we use it.</p>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact & business info</strong> you submit (name, email, phone, company).</li>
<li><strong>Lead/booking details</strong> processed through our forms, SMS, and calendar integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Usage data</strong> (device, pages viewed, timestamps) via analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we use data</h2>
<ul>
<li>To provide and improve our services (qualify leads, book appointments, send summaries).</li>
<li>To communicate with you about demos, onboarding, support, and updates.</li>
<li>To comply with legal obligations and prevent abuse.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SMS Communications</h2>
<p>
  When you provide your phone number, you consent to receive text messages from NovaDesk related to scheduling, demos,
  support, and follow-up about your inquiry. Messages are transactional (customer care) and sent in response to your request.
  Message &amp; data rates may apply. Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to opt out or <strong>HELP</strong> for help at any time.
</p>
<h2>Processors / third parties</h2>
<p>We use reputable providers to operate NovaDesk, for example: email & DNS (Cloudflare), scheduling (Calendly), forms (Formspree), payments (Stripe), messaging/telephony (Twilio), automation (Zapier/Make), storage (Google/Airtable). These providers process data on our behalf under contracts.</p>
<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>We keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes above or as required by law, then delete or anonymize it.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security (encryption in transit, access controls). No system is 100% secure; you use the service at your own risk.</p>
<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>Where applicable, you may request access, correction, deletion, or portability of your data. Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@novadeskapp.com">privacy@novadeskapp.com</a>.</p>
<h2>International transfers</h2>
<p>Your data may be processed outside your region where protections may differ. We implement appropriate safeguards.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>NovaDesk is not for children under 16 and we do not knowingly collect their data.</p>
